#Smart attendance

The attendance system in class rooms has experienced many efficient changes within the past few decades. India, still follows the system of manually taking attendance inside classrooms, the two of which include significant expenses, physical work and human errors In the existing system, attendance is taken manually in every class.So to overcome this problem, web based application which stores data into database automatically used along with facial detection and recognition approach .This is very fast and helpful technique to do the verification of the users. All of the label pictures are trained using a convolutional neural network, which is the class of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to anticipate the output by categorizing the photos in this technique On the database, data analysis will take place.

The input is an image of a person's face, which ispassed through the face detection component to locate the face. The feature extraction component extracts features from the face, which are used to match the person's identity with a database. The output is the identity of the person, which is then used for accesscontrol purposes
